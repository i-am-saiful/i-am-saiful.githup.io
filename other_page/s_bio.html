	<p>
	<b>William Shakespeare</b> was an English poet,playwright and actor.he is regarded as greatest writer in the <br>
	English language and world's pre-eminent dramatist.he is also known as England's national poet and <q>Bard of Avon</q>.
	</p>
    <h2><b> Personal Life </b></h2>   
	<p>
	Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway,<br>
	with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a<br>
	successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men,<br>
	later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later.<br> 
	Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical <br>
	appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were, in fact, written by others. Said <br>
	theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note the fact that few records survive of most commoners of the period.<br>

	<h2><b> Working Life </b></h2> 
	<p>
	Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories,<br>
	and are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. Then, until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them<br>
	Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.In the last phase<br>
	of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances), and collaborated with other playwrights.<br>

    Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and <br>
	friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous <br>
	collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as his. The volume was<br>
	prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which the. poet presciently hails the playwright in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but<br>
	for all time".<br><br>
